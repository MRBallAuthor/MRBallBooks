          And beginnings, Kael had learned, were worth their weight in gold.</p>
<p>“For Corwin. For what’s to come.” He spoke to the sea itself.</p>
<p>But the sea didn’t answer.</p>
<p>It welcomed him all the same.</p>
<p>Not as a boy.</p>
<p>As a warrior.</p>
<p>A captain.</p>
<p>A lover.</p>
<p>A ghost.</p>
<p>This is not a tale of crowns, or seas, or the lies men carve into stone.</p>
<p>It is the tale of a compass…</p>
<p>a kiss…</p>
<p>and a boy who chose the sea.</p>
<p>And the storm that followed him.

      <p> Fires were extinguished. Food was shared. Children danced around the crew, mimicking their swordplay with sticks, oblivious to the weight of the situation but the crew didn’t stop them, they were thankful for the distraction. </p>
<p>“She wanted to stay with me on the command deck,” Kael spoke, giving the healers room to work on her, they had asked him to leave, that it would be better for her if he gave them room to work. </p>
<p>He reluctantly gave in and waited, separate, unknowing of the outcome.</p>
<p>“You were trying to protect her,” Rurik muttered.</p></span>
